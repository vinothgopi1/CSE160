  Notes To Grader:
  - created ground and sky with flattened and big cube
  - used two differnent texture on both the ground and sky
  - the cubes and cactus in my world do not use textures but just color and coexist
  - Camera movement that is interactive with player movement and turns
  - Q and E to turn left and right
  - Perspective camera
  - world is immersive and themed (I hope)
  - had some trouble getting the mouse to look around to work, 
  it would interfere with me being able to create blocks and would mess up my world render
  - ability to add and delete blocks
  - simple story where the goal is to find water in the desert. Once you destroy one water block you win
  - Wow factor you can flip the world upside down (could make it easier to find water blocks). Also keep track 
  of if you find water or not and tell you that you win the game
  - performance not the greatest

  - utilized AI in order to debug code and give some ideas on how to structure the project.
